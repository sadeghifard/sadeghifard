▪︎ Java Developer, 2011 up to now.

▪︎ Spring Cloud, Microservices, Kafka, Kubernetes.

I received my BSc degree in Computer Software engineering (2008) at Payame Noor University of Iran. First off, I learned C++ basics, then I learned effective modern features of C++ with high-performance code. Since beginning 2011, I've been learning Java. I have been using Java and most J2EE frameworks in the enterprise applications in the software companies. Now, I am working on the Spring Cloud by Kafka microservices streaming for a Spring Boot high-scale enterprise application using Kubernetes platform that is called Moghilan banking management system.
