I received my BSc degree in computer software engineering (2008) at Payame Noor University of Iran. First off, I learned C++ basics, then I learned effective modern features of C++ with high-performance code. Since beginning 2011, I've been learning Java. I have been using Java and the most J2EE frameworks in enterprise applications into software companies. Now, I am working on the Cloud architecture and distributed big data processing.
